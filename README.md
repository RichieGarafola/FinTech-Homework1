### *Overview and Origin*
    </center>

Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb founded Ripple in 2012, a payment settlement and remittance company. Ripple uses an asset exchange and remittance system similar to banks' SWIFT system for international money transfers. Using an open source and peer-to-peer decentralized platform, Ripple allows for seamless money transfers in any currency, whether it's fiat money in the form of dollars, pounds, yen or euros or cryptocurrency in the form of Litecoin, Bitcoin or Etherium. Ripple is a global payment network and counts major banks and financial institutions amongst its customers. XRP is used in its products to facilitate quick conversion between different currencies.

Ripple is a privately funded company, which has closed five rounds of funding, including two rounds of angel funding, one round of seed funding, one round of Series A funding, one round of Series B funding, and one round of Series C funding. The primary source of funding Ripple has been sales of the XRP cryptocurrency. According to its own records it sold $1,254.54 million worth of XRP between Q4 2016 and Q2 2020, to a mix of institutional investors and retail investors via sales on cryptoccurrency exchanges. The company's mission is to deliver an efficient system for direct money transfers that can settle in real-time while also being cheaper, more secure, and more transparent than traditional financial institutions' transfer systems. With blockchain and cryptocurrencies, the aim is to revolutionize how cross-border transactions are conducted while bridging fiat and digital currencies.

### * Major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years *
    </center>    

* Ripple is amongst the leading innovators in the Blockchain / Computer Technology domain of the financial industry. *   

- ** Eco-friendly Blockchain ** - The issue of continuous carbon emissions is one of the pitfalls of blockchain technology. Several new innovative approaches are emerging as solutions to this problem, such as carbon offsetting.  However, carbon offsetting is more of a remedial measure for an incident that should not have happened in the first place.
    
- ** Central Banks Digital Currencies ** - As national currencies develop, they target digital currencies that can work alongside traditional currencies. This could enable users to complete financial transactions and manage the custody of their assets on the blockchain. Users don’t have to rely on third-party providers, and central banks could also exercise control over the circulating supply. 
    
- ** Manufacturing and Tracking Vaccines with Blockchain ** - Vaccine shipments could be verified through blockchain and the distribution of vaccines could be traced to ensure that vaccine shipments arrive at their intended locations. Blockchain could also be used to trace vaccine shipments. Could strengthen the verification of vaccine integrity at different points in the supply chain. For example, blockchain technology can help in ensuring the consistent storage of vaccine batches at the right temperature. 
    
- ** Tokenization, Non-fungible tokens or NFTs ** - NFTs are unique digital assets that represent ownership of real-world items like art, video clips, music, and more. The potential of NFTs, exceeds far beyond their initial use cases however.
    
- ** The Rise of the Metaverse ** - A metaverse is essentially a shared virtual world that provides users with immersive experiences. Participants can interact with the metaverse by creating digital avatars that engage them in interactions. These avatars could be used for creating in-world experiences, objects, and landscapes. 
    
- ** Transformation in financial services ** - It is possible through distributed ledger technology to reduce fees and provide real-time payments between financial institutions. Utilizing decentralized ledgers for payments could help to re-imagine global trade finance by driving efficiencies, lowering costs and opening up new revenue opportunities.

### * Core metrics this domain uses to measure success *
    </center>
    
- ** Active Nodes (Active Addresses) ** - This is calculated by compiling and recording how many unique nodes are active during a predetermined time frame, such as per day, per week, or per month. In permissionless blockchains, the higher the number, the stronger indication that more nodes are using and trusting the blockchain. The active nodes value is generally made available to all participating nodes.

- ** Blocks Per Hour, Blocks Per Day ** - Measure the speed at which records are submitted and stored on the blockchain network and how fast the network can carry out its consensus algorithm. Because the capacity of a block is fixed, the quantity of blocks processed can be calculated accordingly. Every block that is created has a timestamp, via the use of timestamps, the blockchain system can measure how many blocks are created and added during specified time periods, such as per hour or per day. The results of these measurements help assess the performance and scalability of the blockchain system.

- ** Transactions Per Second ** - Measures the quantity of records or transaction records submitted and stored per second. It is used to assess the volume of processing a blockchain network is undergoing and to judge its scalability requirements. The quantity of records submitted to the network and the quantity of records stored to the ledger are generally measured separately.

- ** Transaction Latency ** - Measures the time from which a transaction is submitted to the network until the time that the transaction has been written to the ledger (or rejected). This metric is measured by checking the timestamp of transactions and comparing the time they were submitted to the time they were validated and stored. This metric can also provide insight as to how fast consensus algorithms are being carried out.

- ** Transaction Throughput ** - This metric is used to measure the time it takes for valid records to be appended to blocks. The total number of committed and validated records is divided by the total amount of time (in seconds) it takes to commit (validate and store) those records. Any invalid records or transaction records are deducted from the total number because invalid records are not committed.

- ** Full Node/Partial Node Ratio ** - Measures the quantity of active full nodes and partial nodes on a blockchain network and provides a value representing the ratio of full to partial nodes. This measurement is important because if a blockchain network ends up having no active full nodes, it can lose the historical data in the full copy of the distributed ledger. Because of the critical importance of maintaining sufficient redundant copies of the distributed ledger, this measurement is closely tracked.
    
    
Ripple settlement speed is exponentially faster than competitors. Ripple settles in approximately 4 seconds while ETH is 4+ minutes and bitcoin is 1+ hours. Traditional Systems settle between 3-5 days. *

### * My 2-cents *
    </center>

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    
It would be extremely beneficial and incentivize investors to become long term holders if decentralized finance (DeFi) was incorporated into their business model as crypto staking and investment services are appealing to the masses. Gives users more control over their money through personal wallets and trading services that cater to individuals.
    
Since all the XRP coins are pre-mined and already in circulation, a limited supply could push up demand in the future, leading to big price increases and bigger profits for early investors. Staking is a way of supporting the blockchain of a cryptocurrency you're invested in. Cryptocurrencies rely on holders staking to verify transactions and keep everything running smoothly. It's an easy way to earn interest on your holdings while helping to maintain the security and efficiency of the over all blockchain.
    
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
   
      - Will entice long term holders to stay invested as they will be aquiring additional interest.
